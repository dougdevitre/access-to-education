# Access to Education

**A comprehensive Missouri K-12 education navigator powered by AI.**

Answers questions, generates documents, and walks through complex processes for students, parents, teachers, specialists, principals, school staff, and district administrators -- grounded in Missouri law (RSMo 160-178), IDEA, ESSA, and DESE guidance.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Claude Code (recommended)

Clone the repo and open it in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). The `CLAUDE.md` file activates the skill automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dougdevitre/access-to-education.git
cd access-to-education
claude
```

Then just ask a question:

```
> My child was suspended for 10 days. What are our rights?
> /graduation
> Can I retire? I'm 52 with 30 years in.
> Mi hijo necesita una evaluacion. Que hago?
```

### Option 2: Claude Project

1. Create a new [Claude Project](https://claude.ai)
2. Paste the contents of `SKILL.md` as the **custom instructions**
3. Upload everything in `references/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `examples/` as **project knowledge**
4. Start chatting

### Option 3: API / Custom Integration

Use `MANIFEST.json` as the routing layer. It maps every topic to its canonical reference file, making it straightforward to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines or chatbot backends.

## How It Works

The system follows an 11-step process defined in `SKILL.md`:

1. **Detect the role** -- identify who is asking
2. **Check quick-answer layer** -- if it's a common factual question, answer immediately
3. **Apply role recipe** -- shape tone, structure, and depth for the audience
4. **Route to reference files** -- only load files when depth is needed
5. **Reach for templates** -- when the user wants to build a document
6. **Apply guardrails** -- sensitive topics get caveats or redirects
7. **Hand off** -- when the question leaves education, acknowledge and redirect
8. **Walk decision trees** -- for multi-step processes with branching logic
9. **Anticipate follow-ups** -- proactively ask the one question most likely to change the answer
10. **Generate documents** -- produce actual letters, plans, and forms
11. **Respond bilingually** -- Spanish support with English legal terms preserved

---

## Example Interactions

**Parent asking about suspension rights:**
> "My son was suspended for 10 days and the principal said it might be extended. He has ADHD and a 504 plan. What are my rights?"

The system responds with: immediate rights under RSMo 167.161, the MDR requirement before extension, the two MDR questions, what happens under each outcome, specific next steps with exact language to use, and an offer to draft the request letter.

**Teacher asking about retirement:**
> "I'm 52 with 30 years in. Can I retire?"

The system calculates Rule of 80 (52 + 30 = 82), confirms eligibility, estimates the benefit at 75% of final average salary, flags the Social Security/WEP issue, and directs to PSRS.

**Spanish-speaking parent:**
> "Mi hijo necesita ayuda en la escuela pero no se por donde empezar."

The system responds entirely in Spanish, includes English legal terms in parentheses, explains the evaluation request process, provides letter language in both languages, and notes the right to an interpreter at school meetings.

## Data Integrity

All facts are sourced and tracked:

- **Missouri statutes** (RSMo) verified as of 2025-08
- **Federal law** (IDEA, ESSA, FERPA, Title IX) verified as of 2025-08
- **DESE guidance** verified as of 2026-03
- **Volatile data points** (enrollment, contribution rates, scholarship amounts) tracked with source and date in `LAST_VERIFIED.md`
- **Quarterly review cycle** for high-volatility items; annual for medium; 5-year for low
- **Legislative review** due after each Missouri session (next: June 2026)

See `LAST_VERIFIED.md` for the full verification log.

---

## Contributing

Each topic has a single canonical owner file (see `CANONICAL_OWNERS.md`). To update a fact:

1. Find the canonical file for the topic
2. Update the fact with the new source and date
3. Update `LAST_VERIFIED.md` with the verification date
4. Cross-references in other files will point back to the canonical file

### Content Guidelines

- Cite statutes precisely (e.g., RSMo 167.161, IDEA SS300.301)
- Frame legal content as educational information, not legal advice
- Keep files under 500 lines
- Use the existing voice: calm, professional, practical, child-centered, equity-conscious
